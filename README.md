A critical analysis  of filters for X-ray mirrors with subnanometer precision is carried out, not only classical smoothing filters, 
but also specialized filters for filtering X-ray mirrors and processing interferometer data don't eliminate diffraction rings.

This code presents the challenges of eliminating measurement errors of Interferometr Zygo
by filtering in a manner that minimizes smoothing of real-world data while eliminating hardware features.

The proposed Fourier filter of the interferometer data eliminates some measurement errors, 
thereby increasing the accuracy of X-ray mirror measurements to the subnanometer range.
